My feature/mechanic is Kazuha's abilities from Genshin Impact, his E and Q.
- His E starts off with a pull, then he jumps up and goes back down dealing damage
- His Q is an instant aoe that deals damage every few seconds
To play use A and D to move left and right. Use E and Q to use abilities.
Enemy Dummy is the black box, if all health is gone, restart the game to get it back.
